# At this stage, we can't assume anything. There's probably no puppet installed
# We do presume a couple things currently:
#   * A working /bin/sh
#   * sudo installed and configured to allow us to run apt install (TODO)
#   * debian buster (TODO)
#
# Future work:
#   * no sudo / already root
#   * redhat / centos
#   * alpine toybox
#   * debian stretch
#   * ubuntu
